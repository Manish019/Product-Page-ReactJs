# Product Page Using React JS

Product Page Using ReactJS — Project Description

The Product Page is a responsive and dynamic web component built using ReactJS. It showcases detailed information about a product, including its image, title, price, description, reviews, and an option to add the product to a cart.

✅ Key Features:
 Reusable Components: Built with modular React components like ProductCard, ProductDetails, Rating, and AddToCartButton.
 Props & State: Uses props to pass product data and React state to manage user interactions (e.g., quantity, button actions).
 Responsive Design: Styled using CSS/Bootstrap/Tailwind for mobile-first responsiveness.
 Event Handling: Handles user actions like "Add to Cart" or "Buy Now" using onClick events.
 Dynamic Rendering: Displays different product data based on passed props or fetched API data.

# Tech Stack:
ReactJS (Functional components + Hooks)
CSS / SCSS / Tailwind / Bootstrap (for styling)
Optional: Axios/Fetch API (for dynamic data)
React Router (if navigation to/from the product page is involved)

# Sample Use Case:
Used in e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, or any store where products need to be displayed individually with details and user interaction options.
